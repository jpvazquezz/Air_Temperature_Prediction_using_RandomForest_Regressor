# Air Temperature Prediction using Random Forest Regressor
* ## Hourly Weather Surface – Brazil (Southeast region)

The main object is to create a model capable of predicting the air temperature using the Random Forest algorithm. For that, I used the [Hourly Weather Surface – Brazil (Southeast region) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/PROPPG-PPG/hourly-weather-surface-brazil-southeast-region). The main reason for choosing this dataset was for practicing data wrangling and feature engeenering, which are a very time consuming as well as an important part of a data scientist' work.

The dataset covers hourly weather data from 122 weathers stations of southeast region (Brazil). The southeast include the states of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Minas Gerais e Espirito Santo. Dataset Source: INMET (National Meteorological Institute – Brazil).
